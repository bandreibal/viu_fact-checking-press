# Enhanced information retrieval from the press and its underlying ethics

This repository contains the supporting materials for the research work done for the final project of the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence, during the academic year 2023/2024.

It is divided into the following directories:

* **root**: Contains two Jupyter notebooks, one containing the main code for running the framework, as well as another for the execution of the evaluation system. This folder also contains an Excel file containing the results of the evaluation.
* **data**: Pieces of media serving as knowledge base for this instance of the framework.
* **prompts**: Collection of prompts used both in the experimental phase and in the refined one.
* **utils**: Auxiliary functions and data necessary for the execution of the main code.
* **temporal_evals**: Checkpoints of the evaluation of each model.
* **z-experiments**: Notebooks with experiments that were not included in the final implementation.
