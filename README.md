# Enhanced information retrieval from the press and its underlying ethics

This repository contains the supporting materials for the research work done for the final project of the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence, during the academic year 2023/2024.

The data, code, full prompts and evaluation data are fully shared and openly available through the current GitHub repository. The basic information of the code developed as part of this research project is the following:
* **Creator**: Bogdan Andrei Baltes
* **Project**: Research Project for the award of the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence
* **Institution**: VIU - Universidad Internacional de Valencia; Centro ESenCIA - Centro de Estudios en Ciencia de Datos e Inteligencia Artificial
* **Software title**: Enhanced information retrieval from the press and its underlying ethics
* **Software repository**: https://github.com/bandreibal/viu_fact-checking-press
* **Software requirements**: Python 3.9.18
* **Publication date**: March 2024

It is divided into the following directories:

* **root**: Contains two Jupyter notebooks, one containing the main code for running the framework, as well as another for the execution of the evaluation system. This folder also contains an Excel file containing the results of the evaluation.
* **data**: Pieces of media serving as knowledge base for this instance of the framework.
* **prompts**: Collection of prompts used both in the experimental phase and in the refined one.
* **utils**: Auxiliary functions and data necessary for the execution of the main code.
* **temporal_evals**: Checkpoints of the evaluation of each model.
* **z-experiments**: Notebooks with experiments that were not included in the final implementation.
